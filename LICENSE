-By Camden  

The asset you have received is most likely a software product. If it is software, you ARE allowed to use it in public content, such as YouTube videos or blog posts.



If the software is unmodified:

- You don't need to credit me.
- You cannot claim ownership unless I give you explicit permission.
- It's appreciated if you clarify that the asset is not yours. If you don't, you are still legally safe.
- If you don't publish this anywhere, or you have it personally, you're legally safe  



If you modify the software:

You must credit me in one of the following ways:
- By email: camrxox@outlook.com  
- On YouTube: @camr32347fun  
- Via my website: [Camden’s Realm of Projects](https://camr32347.github.io/Camden-s-Realm-Of-Projects/)  
- Or credit the source where you downloaded the software
- If you don't publish this anywhere, or you have it personally, you're legally safe if you don't credit



Approved Sources:

My software should only be downloaded from the following locations:

- [CurseForge Profile](https://www.curseforge.com/members/camr3234/projects)  
- [Camden’s Realm of Projects](https://camr32347.github.io/Camden-s-Realm-Of-Projects/)
- [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@camr32347fun)  
- [Planet Minecraft Page](https://www.planetminecraft.com/member/camr3234/)



If you obtained the software from another source:

- Do not email me a link to the exact webpage.
- If it's from a social media page, email me the username and platform
- If it’s a website, email me the website URL without the domain extension.

Physical Assets

-If you received a physical item, it’s probably not mine. I primarily make digital software.

Extra note.

-Doesn't matter what you obtained, if it's modified or if it's not, if you made a video or blog post on it, I would like to be emailed at camrxox@outlook.com, you don't have to.
